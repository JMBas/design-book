# Preface

FAST is an infinitely recursive framework for platforming. It pairs exploration of [platforming](appendix/glossary/) opportunities with iterative design and development of matching propositions.

There is no shortage in publications on [platforms](appendix/glossary/) and their social and economic impact. While these help in understanding _Why_ and _What_,  _How_ is much less served. FAST addresses how to spot a blurry opportunity and turn that into a sustainable platform business.

## Audience

## Acknowledgement

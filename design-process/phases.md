# Phases

Design Thinking draws from the designer's toolbox for non-typical design contexts, like business strategy or social innovation. As an approach to innovation, it combines [_exploring problems_, _building empathy_ and _prototyping solutions_](http://www.jonkolko.com/writingDesignThinking.php)_._ This combination fits the challenges in platforming well:

![FAST Design Phases](../.gitbook/assets/fast-model-tris-rounded-70.jpg)

* \*\*\*\*[**EXPLORE**](../design-phases/ecosystem-exploration.md) the ecosystem to design for. The people, organisations and things acting in context, and the trends and forces as they surface in that context. Gather data without judgement and build understanding.
* \*\*\*\*[**SYNTHESISE**](../design-phases/platform-synthesis.md) actionable insights from the data gathered. Identify reoccurring problems, expose unexpressed needs and uncover sought after convenience. Capture and prioritise these in a platform model.
* \*\*\*\*[**DEVELOP**](../design-phases/platform-development.md) validating solutions. Deconstruct the platform model into its hypotheses and bring it to life with a series of pass/fail tests to run in front of the envisioned platform participants. Build, measure, learn.

This approach is non-prescriptive and its three phases are wholly complementary. Each feeds the other, and each sets boundaries for the other.

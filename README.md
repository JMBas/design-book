# Preface

FAST is a framework for [platforming](appendix/glossary.md#platforming). It pairs exploration of platforming opportunities with their development into scalable businesses.

There is no shortage in publications on [platforms](appendix/glossary.md#platform) and their socio-economic impact. While these for sure help in understanding why and what of platforms, how to build and evolve one is much less covered.

FAST addresses these concerns in an iterative process of platforming. It'll take you from exploring a fuzzy hunch of opportunity all the way to running a scaled platform businessâ€”and back.

## Audience

FAST squarely aims for addressing actual challenges in platforming. There is little to none education on the topics of platforms, strategic planning, service design and software development.

Of course, learning on these topics by working through the FAST framework may be an interesting exercise in itself. The [Glossary](appendix/glossary.md) and [References](appendix/references.md) would make for a good start.

## Acronym

Futuring Architectures for Sustained Transformation.

For one, this emphasises the strategic intention and infinitely iterative nature of the framework. It also works as a convenient adjective in many situations.

## Acknowledgement

A notable aspect of FAST is it aggregating existing knowledge, tools and practices. It is a true product of the work from many in the fields of platform economy, strategic planning, service design and agile software development. 

[Abhimanyu Bhardwaj's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhardwajabhimanyu/) [Tris framework](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-plan-save-design-thinking-abhimanyu-bhardwaj/) motivated making the crucial [design-development leap](design-process/phases.md).

[Jesse Grimes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessegrimes/) opened the door for framing service design in a context of [emergence](https://design.platforminteraction.com/appendix/glossary/e). The resulting [presentation at SDGC 2017](https://speakerdeck.com/absynthmind/platform-ecosystems-designing-for-potential-sdgc-2017) lit the fire under FAST.

[Platform Design Toolkit](https://platformdesigntoolkit.com/) has been instrumental in the gestation of FAST. It figures front and centre in the [Synthesise phase](design-phases/synthesise/), which also takes many insights from the Toolkit's [masterclasses](https://platformdesigntoolkit.com/public-masterclass/) and [newsletters](https://us11.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=e272a9d50c52efb331777c60a&id=b0460ae881).

[Sangeet Paul Choudary's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sangeetpaul/) [Platform Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Platform-Scale-emerging-business-investment-ebook/dp/B015FAOKJ6) set the template for a systems oriented approach to platforming.
